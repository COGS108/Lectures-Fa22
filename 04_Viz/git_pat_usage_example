# a password will have the username/password stored in plain text -- NOT SECURE! :)
# but since you are using a Personal Access Token this isn't really a problem.
# 1) PATs are revokable and they expire after a short period (I'd suggest ~2 weeks past end of quarter)
# 2) Somone can read your PAT only if they have access to your datahub account already
# Follow the instructions we gave (or a web tutorial) on how to generate a PAT! Then do this...

# now do a git operation that requires a password, such as trying to clone a private repo (e.g., project group repo)
# the put in your github username and copy/paste the PAT when it asks for a password
